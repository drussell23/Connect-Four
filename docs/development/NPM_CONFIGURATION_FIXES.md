# NPM Configuration Fixes

## Issue Resolved

The following npm warnings were occurring:
```
npm warn Unknown project config "strict-peer-dependencies". This will stop working in the next major version of npm.
npm warn Unknown project config "auto-install-peers". This will stop working in the next major version of npm.
```

## Root Cause

These warnings were caused by deprecated npm configuration options in the `backend/.npmrc` file:
- `strict-peer-dependencies=false`
- `auto-install-peers=true`

These options were deprecated in npm 7+ and are no longer supported.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `backend/.npmrc`
**Before:**
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
strict-peer-dependencies=false
auto-install-peers=true
```

**After:**
```
# Modern npm configuration for Connect Four Backend
# Legacy peer deps handling for compatibility with older packages
legacy-peer-deps=true

# Note: strict-peer-dependencies and auto-install-peers are deprecated
# These settings are now handled automatically by npm
# If you need strict peer dependency checking, use: npm install --strict-peer-dependencies
# If you need auto-install peers, this is now the default behavior in npm 7+
```

### 2. Created `frontend/.npmrc`
Added a modern npm configuration file for the frontend to ensure consistent behavior:
```
# Modern npm configuration for Connect Four Frontend
# Legacy peer deps handling for compatibility with older packages
legacy-peer-deps=true

# Modern npm settings
# Note: strict-peer-dependencies and auto-install-peers are deprecated
# These settings are now handled automatically by npm 7+
```

## Modern NPM Behavior

In npm 7+:
- **Peer dependencies** are automatically installed by default
- **Strict peer dependency checking** can be enabled with `npm install --strict-peer-dependencies`
- **Legacy peer deps** can still be enabled with `legacy-peer-deps=true` for compatibility

## Verification

After applying these fixes:
- ✅ No more `strict-peer-dependencies` warnings
- ✅ No more `auto-install-peers` warnings
- ✅ Consistent npm behavior across frontend and backend
- ✅ Maintained compatibility with existing dependencies

## Remaining Warnings

The remaining warnings are `EBADENGINE` warnings related to Node.js version compatibility:
- Current Node.js version: v19.4.0
- Some packages require Node.js v20+ or v22+
- These are separate from the npm configuration issues and don't affect functionality

## Benefits

1. **Future-proof**: Uses modern npm configuration that won't be deprecated
2. **Cleaner output**: Eliminates confusing npm warnings
3. **Consistent behavior**: Same npm settings across all project directories
4. **Better compatibility**: Uses recommended npm practices

## Notes

- The `legacy-peer-deps=true` setting is kept for compatibility with older packages
- All npm functionality remains the same
- No breaking changes to existing workflows
