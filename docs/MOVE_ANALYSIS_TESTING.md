# Move Analysis Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Move Analysis functionality to ensure that the 404 errors are resolved and the system works correctly.

## Problem Statement

The original issue was:
```
moveAnalysisService.ts:112 GET http://localhost:3000/games/3dzk0wkz4/board 404 (Not Found)
moveAnalysisService.ts:114 ✅ Game 3dzk0wkz4 check result: 404 Not Found
moveAnalysisService.ts:123 ⏳ Game 3dzk0wkz4 not found, retrying in 500ms...
```

## Solution Implemented

### Root Cause
The 404 errors were caused by two issues:

1. **API URL Mismatch**: The frontend was calling `http://localhost:3000/games/{gameId}/analyze-move` but the backend endpoint was at `http://localhost:3000/api/games/{gameId}/analyze-move` (with the `/api` prefix due to `app.setGlobalPrefix('api')`).

2. **Game State Synchronization**: There was a mismatch between how games were created (via WebSocket) and how the move analysis service attempted to fetch board states via REST API. The frontend often already possessed the current game board state, making the backend fetch unnecessary and prone to timing issues.

### Resolution
1. **API URL Fix**: Corrected the `API_BASE_URL` in `moveAnalysisService.ts` to include the `/api` prefix
2. **Frontend Board State Integration**: Modified `MoveExplanation` component to accept and use frontend board state
3. **Smart Fallback System**: Implemented retry mechanism with graceful fallback to mock analysis
4. **API Call Optimization**: Use frontend board state when available, only fetch from backend when necessary

## Test Cases

### 1. Backend Integration Tests (Integration Scripts)

#### Game Creation and Board Access

- ✅ Handle different move columns correctly
- ✅ Handle different AI levels correctly
- ✅ Handle both player and AI move analysis
- ✅ Return 404 for move analysis on non-existent game
