# Skip specific tests for development/local environments
# B104: Binding to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) - acceptable for local development
# B608: Hardcoded SQL query - not applicable to our use case
# B101: Assert used - acceptable in test environments

# We'll address these issues in code rather than suppress them:
# B614: Unsafe PyTorch load - will fix by using weights_only=True
# B324: Weak MD5 hash - will replace with SHA256

# Tests to skip (only for development environments)
