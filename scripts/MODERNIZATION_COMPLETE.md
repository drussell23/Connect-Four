   # OLD (DEPRECATED)
   node scripts/parallel-launcher.js
   node scripts/smart-turbo-launcher.js
   ./scripts/model-management/advanced-model-cleanup.sh
   
   # NEW (ENTERPRISE)
   node scripts/unified-enterprise-launcher.js
   node scripts/enterprise-parallel-launcher.js
   node scripts/enterprise-model-manager.js
   ```

2. **✅ UNIFIED ENTRY POINT**: Use the new single entry point
   ```bash
   # Main platform launcher
   node scripts/unified-enterprise-launcher.js
   
   # Quick profile launches
   node scripts/unified-enterprise-launcher.js --profile enterprise
   node scripts/unified-enterprise-launcher.js --profile production
   ```

3. **✅ LEGACY CLEANUP**: The following scripts are now redundant:
   - `ai-diagnostics.js` → Use `advanced-ai-diagnostics.js`
   - `parallel-launcher.js` → Use `enterprise-parallel-launcher.js`
   - `enhanced-process-manager.js` → Use `intelligent-resource-manager.js`
   - `performance-demo.sh` → Use `performance-analytics-suite.js`
   - `smart-turbo-launcher.js` → Use `unified-enterprise-launcher.js`

### **Recommended Workflow:**

1. **🌟 Primary**: Use `unified-enterprise-launcher.js` as main entry point
2. **🚀 Development**: Launch "Development" profile for coding
3. **🏭 Production**: Launch "Production" profile for deployment
