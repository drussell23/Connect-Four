## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### **🔄 Enhanced Restart Commands**

**For normal development (recommended):**
```bash
npm run restart:turbo:build:enhanced:force:clean
```

**This comprehensive command:**
- ✅ **Kills all processes** (frontend, backend, launcher)
- ✅ **Detects and kills zombie processes** on port 3001
- ✅ **Cleans up stale state and PID files**  
- ✅ **Forces a fresh rebuild** with clean cache
- ✅ **Prevents "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" errors**
- ✅ **Provides browser cache clearing instructions** for React Suspense fixes
- ✅ **Performs comprehensive system resource analysis**
- ✅ **Runs enterprise-grade health monitoring**
- ✅ **Provides detailed user experience enhancements**

**Other useful commands:**
```bash
# Stop all services
npm run stop:turbo:enhanced

# Start services
npm run start:turbo:build:enhanced

# Check service status
npm run status:turbo:enhanced
```

### **🧟 Zombie Process Prevention & React Suspense Fixes**

**Problem:** React development servers can become "zombie processes" that continue running even after you think you've shut them down, serving stale bundles and causing React Suspense errors.

**Solution:** Enhanced restart command that automatically detects and kills zombie processes:

```bash
# 🧟 Enhanced restart with zombie process detection & browser instructions
npm run restart:turbo:build:enhanced:force:clean

# 🔍 Check for zombie processes
npm run zombie:check

# 💀 Kill zombie processes manually
npm run zombie:kill
```

**What this command does:**
- ✅ **Detect zombie processes** on port 3001 and other common ports
- ✅ **Kill stale React development servers** automatically
- ✅ **Clear build cache** to remove stale files
- ✅ **Provide browser cache clearing instructions** for React Suspense fixes
- ✅ **Prevent "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" errors**
- ✅ **Ensure fresh code is always running**

**If you still see React Suspense errors:**
1. **Clear browser cache**: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Chrome) or DevTools → Empty Cache and Hard Reload
2. **Unregister service workers**: DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Unregister
3. **Clear all data**: `chrome://settings/clearBrowserData`

## 📸 Real-Time Board State Tracking

### **🎯 Live Move Analysis System**

Our Connect Four AI now features **real-time board state tracking** that captures and analyzes the board configuration before and after each move, providing unprecedented insight into the game's progression.

#### **📊 How Real-Time Board Tracking Works**

```typescript
// Board state tracking implementation
interface BoardStateTracking {
  boardBeforeMove: string[][];    // Board state before the move
  boardAfterMove: string[][];     // Board state after the move
  lastMoveColumn: number;         // Column where the move was made
  lastMovePlayer: 'player' | 'ai'; // Who made the move
  moveTimestamp: number;          // When the move was made
  analysisData?: MoveAnalysis;    // AI analysis of the move
}

// Real-time capture during gameplay
const captureBoardState = (board: string[][], moveColumn: number, player: 'player' | 'ai') => {
  // Capture before state (already done in onColumnClick)
  const boardBefore = board.map(row => [...row]);
  
  // After move is processed by backend, capture after state
  const boardAfter = updatedBoard.map(row => [...row]);
  
  // Store for analysis
  setBoardBeforeMove(boardBefore);
  setBoardAfterMove(boardAfter);
  setLastMoveColumn(moveColumn);
  setLastMovePlayer(player);
};
```

#### **🔍 Move Analysis with Real Board States**

```typescript
// Enhanced move analysis using captured board states
const analyzeCurrentMove = async () => {
  if (!board || !currentPlayer || !gameId || lastMoveColumn === -1) return;

  try {
    // Use the captured board states and last move information
    const analysis = await analyzeCurrentPosition(
      board, 
      lastMovePlayer, 
      aiLevel, 
      gameId, 
      boardBeforeMove,  // ✅ Real before state
      boardAfterMove,   // ✅ Real after state
      lastMoveColumn    // ✅ Actual move column
    );
    
    console.log('Real AI move analysis completed:', analysis);
    setShowMoveAnalysis(true);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to analyze current move:', error);
  }
};
```

const [boardBeforeMove, setBoardBeforeMove] = useState<string[][]>([]);
const [boardAfterMove, setBoardAfterMove] = useState<string[][]>([]);
const [lastMoveColumn, setLastMoveColumn] = useState<number>(-1);
const [lastMovePlayer, setLastMovePlayer] = useState<'player' | 'ai'>('player');

// Enhanced column click handler with board state capture
function onColumnClick(col: number) {
  // Capture board state before the move
  if (board) {
    const boardBefore = board.map(row => [...row]);
    setBoardBeforeMove(boardBefore);
    setLastMoveColumn(col);
    setLastMovePlayer('player');
    console.log('📸 Board state captured before move');
  }
  
  // Send move to server
  socket.emit('dropDisc', { gameId, playerId: 'Red', column: col });
}

// Enhanced socket handlers for board state capture
socket.on('playerMove', (data) => {
  setBoard(data.board);
  
  // Capture board state after player move for analysis
  setBoardAfterMove(data.board);
  setLastMoveColumn(data.lastMove.column);
  setLastMovePlayer('player');
  console.log('📸 Board state captured after player move');
});

socket.on('aiMove', (data) => {
  setBoard(data.board);
  
  // Capture board state after AI move for analysis
  setBoardAfterMove(data.board);
  setLastMoveColumn(data.lastMove.column);
  setLastMovePlayer('ai');
  console.log('📸 Board state captured after AI move');
});
```

**Backend API Integration:**

): Promise<{ explanation: MoveExplanation; insights: StrategicInsights }> =>
  moveAnalysisService.analyzeCurrentPosition(
    boardState, currentPlayer, aiLevel, gameId, 
    boardBeforeMove, boardAfterMove, lastMoveColumn
  );
```

## 📊 API Reference

### **Real-Time Board Analysis API**
```typescript
// Move analysis with real board states
POST /api/games/:id/analyze-move
{
  "column": 3,
  "player": "player",
  "aiLevel": 8,
  "boardBeforeMove": [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0], ...],  // Real before state
  "boardAfterMove": [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0], ...],   // Real after state
  "lastMoveColumn": 3
}

// Response with real board analysis
{
  "explanation": {
    "primaryReason": "Blocks opponent's winning threat",
    "strategicGoals": ["Control center", "Build threat"],
    "alternativeAnalysis": [...],
    "boardState": {
      "before": [[...]],  // Real before state
      "after": [[...]],   // Real after state
      "highlights": [3]   // Actual move column
    }
  },
  "insights": {
    "moveQuality": 0.87,
    "confidence": 0.92,
    "strategicValue": 0.78,
    "tacticalAdvantage": 0.85
  }
}
```

### **Game API Endpoints**
```typescript
// REST API
POST   /api/games              // Create new game
GET    /api/games/:id          // Get game state
POST   /api/games/:id/moves    // Make move
DELETE /api/games/:id          // End game

// WebSocket Events
connect     → 'game:join'
move        → 'game:move' 
ai_thinking → 'game:ai_thinking'
game_update → 'game:update'
game_end    → 'game:end'
```
