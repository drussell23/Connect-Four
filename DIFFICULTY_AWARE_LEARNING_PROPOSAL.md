# ðŸŽ¯ Difficulty-Aware Continuous Learning Proposal

## Current Limitation

Currently, the AI learns from losses globally without considering difficulty levels. This means:
- A loss at level 1 updates the same model used by all levels
- Pattern defenses are not difficulty-specific
- Learning transfer between levels is implicit and uncontrolled

## Proposed Enhancement

### 1. **Difficulty-Segmented Experience Replay**
```python
class DifficultyAwareExperienceBuffer:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int = 100000):
        self.buffers = {
            level: ExperienceBuffer(capacity // 10) 
            for level in range(1, 11)
        }
        self.cross_level_buffer = ExperienceBuffer(capacity // 2)
        
    def add(self, experience: Dict[str, Any], priority: float = None):
        difficulty = experience.get('difficulty', 5)
        
        # Add to difficulty-specific buffer
        self.buffers[difficulty].add(experience, priority)
        
        # Also add losses to cross-level buffer for transfer learning
        if experience.get('outcome') == 'loss':
            self.cross_level_buffer.add(experience, priority * 1.5)
```

### 2. **Pattern Defense Registry by Difficulty**
```typescript
interface DifficultyAwareDefense {
  pattern: LossPattern;
  defensesByLevel: Map<number, DefenseStrategy>;
  crossLevelInsights: string[];
  minEffectiveLevel: number;
  maxTestedLevel: number;
}

class EnhancedPatternDefenseService {
  private defenseRegistry: Map<string, DifficultyAwareDefense> = new Map();
  
  async learnFromLoss(
    lossPattern: LossPattern, 
    board: CellValue[][], 
    difficulty: number
  ) {
    // Store pattern defense specific to difficulty
    const patternKey = `${lossPattern.type}_${difficulty}`;
    
    // But also propagate insights upward
    for (let level = difficulty; level <= 10; level++) {
      this.propagateDefenseKnowledge(lossPattern, difficulty, level);
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. **Adaptive Difficulty Transfer**
```python
def apply_difficulty_transfer(source_level: int, target_level: int, 
                            pattern_knowledge: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Transfer pattern knowledge between difficulty levels
    """
    transfer_factor = 1.0 - abs(target_level - source_level) * 0.1
    
    adapted_knowledge = {
        'pattern': pattern_knowledge['pattern'],
        'confidence': pattern_knowledge['confidence'] * transfer_factor,
        'blocking_moves': pattern_knowledge['blocking_moves'],
        'search_depth_boost': max(0, pattern_knowledge.get('search_depth_boost', 0) + 
                                  (target_level - source_level))
    }
    
    return adapted_knowledge
```

### 4. **Implementation Changes Needed**

#### In `game.service.ts`:
```typescript
// Include difficulty in loss pattern analysis
const gameData = {
  // ... existing fields
  difficulty: game.difficulty,
  lossPattern: lossPattern ? {
    ...lossPattern,
    occurredAtDifficulty: game.difficulty
  } : null,
  difficultyContext: {
    searchDepth: this.getDifficultySearchDepth(game.difficulty),
    pruningAggressiveness: this.getDifficultyPruning(game.difficulty)
  }
};
```

#### In `continuous_learning.py`:
```python
async def process_game_outcome(self, game_data: Dict[str, Any]):
    difficulty = game_data.get('difficulty', 5)
    
    # Segment learning by difficulty
    if game_data['outcome'] == 'loss':
        # High priority for losses at current difficulty
        self.difficulty_buffers[difficulty].add(game_data, priority=2.0)
        
        # Medium priority for adjacent difficulties
        for adj_diff in [difficulty - 1, difficulty + 1]:
            if 1 <= adj_diff <= 10:
                self.difficulty_buffers[adj_diff].add(
                    game_data, 
                    priority=1.5 * (1 - abs(difficulty - adj_diff) * 0.1)
                )
```

### 5. **Benefits of Difficulty-Aware Learning**

1. **Progressive Mastery**: AI at level 2 specifically learns from level 1 losses
2. **Difficulty-Appropriate Responses**: Level 10 doesn't overreact to level 1 patterns
3. **Transfer Learning**: Insights propagate upward but with appropriate scaling
4. **Maintained Challenge Curve**: Each level preserves its intended difficulty

### 6. **Example Scenario with Enhancement**

```
Player beats AI at level 1 with horizontal pattern:
- Level 1: Learns specific defense with high priority
- Level 2: Receives pattern alert with 90% confidence
- Level 3: Receives pattern alert with 80% confidence
- ...
- Level 10: Receives pattern alert with 10% confidence

Next game at level 2:
- AI has adapted specifically for level 2 play
- Knows about horizontal threat from level 1
- Applies appropriate defensive depth for level 2
- Pattern won't work the same way
```

## Implementation Effort

- **Backend (TypeScript)**: 2-3 hours
  - Modify game.service.ts
  - Enhance PatternDefenseService
  - Update ContinuousLearningService

- **ML Service (Python)**: 3-4 hours
  - Implement DifficultyAwareExperienceBuffer
  - Modify training to be difficulty-aware
  - Add transfer learning logic

- **Testing**: 1-2 hours
  - Verify pattern defense transfers correctly
  - Test difficulty progression
  - Ensure no regression

Total: ~8-10 hours of development

## Decision Point

The current system provides general learning that helps all difficulty levels, but doesn't maintain specific pattern resilience per level. 

**Should we implement difficulty-aware learning?**

Pros:
- More realistic AI progression
- Better player experience
- True adaptive difficulty

Cons:
- More complex system
- Requires more memory
- Longer training times per level
